# netduma-test

I know i didnt complete as much as i wanted but if i had 2 weeks to complete the project i would of updated the styling. I also would of looked into turning it into a PWA so that it could be accessed anywhere and at anytime.

I would use a frontend framework to complete this task to help save time and also help with performance of the app. 

I encountered some problems with getting the results of my array call to display in the div that i had created. If i got errors it was showing me that innerHTML wasnt a function and the same with appendChild. 

I have pushed what code i have to the github repo. 

cheers
Darryl
